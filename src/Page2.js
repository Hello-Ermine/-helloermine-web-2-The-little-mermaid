          When she was fifteen years old, her grandmother decorated her hair
          with lilies. Then she ordered eight oysters to attach themselves to
          her tail. She started swimming up to the surface to the sea. As she
          reached the surface, Ariel saw a large ship in which sailors were
          singing and dancing. She quietly continues watching them.
